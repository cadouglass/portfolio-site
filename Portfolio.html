			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>I am a Bay Area product designer with a background in film and media theory. My experience in writing and making movies informs my design process. I like to build things and am fascinated by the way in which people relate to the various screens they encounter.</p>
			<p>I like to always be learning. Before I was learning about design and now I'm tryna get my code on.</p>
